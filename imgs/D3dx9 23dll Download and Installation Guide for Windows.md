## Download and Install the Latest Version of DirectX
 
One of the easiest ways to fix the D3dx9\_23.dll missing error is to download and install the latest version of DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from the official Microsoft website[^1^].

Note that this package does not modify the DirectX Runtime installed on your Windows OS in any way.

5. Restart your computer and try to run the game or program that gave you the error.

## Manually Copy the File from the Game Disc to the Game Folder
 
If downloading and installing the latest version of DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer does not fix the error, you can try to manually copy the D3dx9\_23.dll file from the game disc to the game folder. This may work for some games that have this file on their installation disc. To do this, follow these steps:
