# How to Use the Smith and Wesson Serial Number Database to Find Out More About Your Gun
 
If you own a Smith & Wesson firearm, you might be curious about its history and specifications. One of the easiest ways to learn more about your gun is to use the Smith and Wesson serial number database, which can provide valuable information such as the date and place of manufacture, the model name, and the features of your gun.
 
The serial number is a unique identifier that is stamped on a metal plate on the frame of your gun near the trigger guard[^1^]. You can either enter the number on Smith & Wesson's website under "Support" and "Serial Number Lookup"[^1^] or consult the "Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson" book by Supica and Nahas[^2^] [^4^] to find out more details based on the number.

However, you should also pay attention to the model name and the letter prefix of your serial number, as Smith & Wesson sometimes used overlapping serial numbers for different models[^2^]. For example, a K-frame Military & Police revolver could have the same serial number as an I-frame .32 Hand Ejector or an N-frame in .44 Special or .45 ACP[^2^]. After World War II, Smith & Wesson began adding letters before the serial numbers on its commercial guns, which helped to distinguish them better[^2^].
