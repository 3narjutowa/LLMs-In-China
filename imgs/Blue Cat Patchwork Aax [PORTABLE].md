1. Cut the fabric for the patchwork background into squares of the same size. The size of the squares depends on the size of your quilt and the size of your appliques. For example, if you want to make a lap-sized quilt with 6-inch appliques, you can cut 8-inch squares for the background.
2. Arrange the squares in a pleasing layout on your design wall or floor. You can follow a specific pattern or go with a random arrangement.
3. Sew the squares together into rows, then sew the rows together to form the patchwork top. Press the seams open or to one side.
4. Cut out the blue cat appliques from the fabric using the pattern. You can use scissors or a rotary cutter for this step.
5. Trace the embroidery details of the appliques onto the fusible web using a pencil or a marker. Follow the instructions on the fusible web package to fuse it to the wrong side of the applique fabric.
6. Cut out the appliques along the traced lines, leaving a small margin around them.
7. Peel off the paper backing from the fusible web and position the appliques on the patchwork top. You can use pins or basting spray to hold them in place temporarily.
8. Iron the appliques to fuse them permanently to the background. Follow the instructions on the fusible web package for the correct temperature and duration.
9. Stitch around the edges of the appliques using your sewing machine and a straight or zigzag stitch. You can also use decorative stitches if you prefer.
10. Add embroidery details to the appliques using embroidery floss and an embroidery needle. You can use any stitch you like, but we recommend using x-stitch for simplicity and consistency. To make an x-stitch, bring your needle up at one corner of a square, then down at the opposite corner. Then bring your needle up at the other corner of the same square, then down at the opposite corner. Repeat this process until you fill up all the squares on your applique.
11. Finish your quilt by adding batting, backing, and binding as usual.
