Laila Majnu is based on a real story that took place in the 7th century in Arabia. The lovers were Laila bint Mahdi ibn Umayya and Qays ibn al-Mulawwah, who belonged to rival tribes. Qays fell in love with Laila at first sight, and became obsessed with her. He would compose poems in her praise, and recite them in public. His love for Laila earned him the nickname Majnu, which means madman in Arabic.
 
Laila's father, however, did not approve of Qays' love for his daughter, and arranged her marriage with another man from a wealthy and powerful tribe. Qays was heartbroken, and wandered in the desert, lamenting his fate. He eventually met a mystic who taught him the secrets of divine love. Qays realized that his love for Laila was a reflection of his love for God, and that he could attain union with God through his love for Laila.
 
Laila, meanwhile, was unhappy in her marriage, and longed for Qays. She secretly sent him messages through a friend, and hoped to see him again. One night, she managed to escape from her husband's house, and met Qays in the desert. They spent a blissful night together, but were discovered by Laila's husband and his men. A fierce fight ensued, and Qays was fatally wounded. He died in Laila's arms, whispering her name. Laila also died of grief soon after.
 
Their tragic story became a legend, and was immortalized by many poets and writers over the centuries. The most famous version of the story is by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, who wrote it in the 12th century. Nizami added many details and embellishments to the original story, and made it more symbolic and mystical. His version influenced many later adaptations of the story in different languages and media.
