## What is Numerical Analysis?
 
Numerical analysis is the branch of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for obtaining numerical solutions to problems involving continuous variables. Such problems arise throughout the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and business. For example, how can we find the roots of a polynomial equation? How can we approximate the area under a curve? How can we solve a system of linear equations? How can we simulate the motion of a pendulum? These are some of the questions that numerical analysis can help us answer.

Numerical analysis is different from symbolic or analytical methods, which aim to find exact solutions to problems using algebraic manipulations and symbolic representations. Numerical analysis, on the other hand, uses numerical approximations and iterative methods to find approximate solutions that are accurate enough for practical purposes. Numerical analysis also takes into account the sources of error and uncertainty that arise from the use of finite precision arithmetic and discretization of continuous domains.
  
## Why is Numerical Analysis Important?
 
Numerical analysis is important because it enables us to solve problems that are too complex or impractical to solve by other means. Numerical analysis also allows us to investigate and provide accurate solutions to real-life problems from various fields of science, engineering, biology, astrophysics, and finance. Some of the major applications of numerical analysis are:

- **Car safety enhancements**: Car makers around the globe use numerical simulations to evaluate and enhance car safety. Pedestrian protection is also kept in mind while investigating car crash tests[^2^].
- **Weather forecasting**: Numerical models based on differential equations are used to predict the atmospheric conditions and climate changes. These models require sophisticated numerical methods and high-performance computing to produce reliable forecasts.
- **Image processing**: Numerical algorithms are used to manipulate and enhance digital images, such as filtering, compression, restoration, segmentation, and recognition. These algorithms involve operations such as matrix multiplication, convolution, interpolation, and transformation.
- **Cryptanalysis**: Numerical methods are used to break cryptographic systems and codes by finding the factors of large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems. These methods rely on techniques such as modular arithmetic, primality testing, and lattice reduction.
- **Machine learning**: Numerical methods are essential for developing and training machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and deep learning. These methods involve optimization, linear algebra, statistics, and calculus.
