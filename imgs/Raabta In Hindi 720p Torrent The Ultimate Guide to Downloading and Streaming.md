The movie starts with Shiv (Sushant Singh Rajput), a banker who moves to Budapest for work. There he meets Saira (Kriti Sanon), a chocolatier who has a fear of water and recurring dreams of drowning. They instantly feel a connection and start dating, but their relationship is threatened by the arrival of Zakir (Jim Sarbh), a wealthy businessman who claims to be Saira's lover from a previous life. Zakir kidnaps Saira and takes her to an island where he reveals that they were warriors in ancient India who were killed by Shiv's lookalike. He also tells her that he has been waiting for her for 800 years and wants to kill Shiv to complete their raabta (connection).
 
The movie then shifts to the flashback scenes of the past life, where Shiv's lookalike is Jilaan, a warrior prince who falls in love with Saira's lookalike, Saiba, a princess of a rival kingdom. They elope and get married, but are betrayed by Zakir's lookalike, Kaabir, who is Jilaan's friend and Saiba's fiance. Kaabir kills Jilaan and Saiba by drowning them in a lake.
 
The movie then returns to the present, where Shiv manages to rescue Saira from Zakir with the help of his friend Radha (Varun Sharma) and a local cop (Rajkummar Rao in a cameo). They escape from the island and reach Budapest, where they confront Zakir again. Zakir tries to kill Shiv by drowning him in a pool, but Saira saves him by overcoming her fear of water. They then realize that they are the reincarnations of Jilaan and Saiba and that their love is stronger than death. They kiss and live happily ever after.
