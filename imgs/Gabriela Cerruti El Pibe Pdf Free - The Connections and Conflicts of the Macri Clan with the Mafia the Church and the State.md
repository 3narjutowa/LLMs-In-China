In this article, we will review some of the main themes and topics that Cerruti discusses in her book, and how they relate to Maradona's life and legacy.
 
## Maradona and Argentina
 
One of the central aspects of Cerruti's book is how Maradona embodied the Argentine identity and culture, and how he influenced the collective imagination and emotions of his country. Cerruti argues that Maradona was not only a soccer player, but also a political and social actor, who represented the hopes and frustrations of millions of Argentines.
 
Cerruti traces Maradona's origins to the poor and marginalized neighborhood of Villa Fiorito, where he grew up in a large and humble family. She describes how Maradona developed his extraordinary skills and passion for soccer at a young age, and how he became a prodigy who amazed everyone with his talent. She also shows how Maradona faced discrimination and prejudice from the elites and the media, who looked down on him for his humble background and his rebellious attitude.
 
Cerruti then follows Maradona's rise to fame and glory, as he moved from Argentina to Spain and then to Italy, where he reached his peak with Napoli. She highlights how Maradona became a national hero and a source of pride for Argentines, especially after his legendary performance in the 1986 World Cup, where he led his team to victory against England, Germany, and Brazil. She also analyzes how Maradona expressed his political views and his solidarity with the oppressed and the marginalized, such as the victims of the dictatorship, the workers, the indigenous people, and the poor.
 
Cerruti also explores Maradona's decline and fall, as he succumbed to drug addiction, health problems, and scandals that tarnished his image and career. She reveals how Maradona suffered from the pressure and the expectations that were placed on him by his fans and his critics, and how he struggled to cope with his fame and fortune. She also exposes how Maradona was exploited and manipulated by unscrupulous agents, managers, doctors, lawyers, and journalists, who took advantage of his vulnerability and his generosity.
 
Cerruti concludes by reflecting on Maradona's death and legacy, and how he left an indelible mark on Argentina and the world. She argues that Maradona was not only a soccer legend, but also a cultural phenomenon, who transcended sports and politics. She claims that Maradona was a complex and contradictory human being, who had flaws and virtues, but who always remained authentic and loyal to his principles. She also suggests that Maradona was a symbol of resistance and hope for many people who identified with his struggle and his joy.
