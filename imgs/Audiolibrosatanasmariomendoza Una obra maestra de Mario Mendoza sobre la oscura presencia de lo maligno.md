 Here is what I created:  
One of the most popular and controversial works by Mario Mendoza is SatanÃ¡s, a novel based on the true story of Campo ElÃ­as Delgado, a former soldier and serial killer who massacred 29 people in a restaurant in BogotÃ¡ in 1986. The novel explores the psychological and social factors that led Delgado to commit such a horrific act, as well as the connections between his life and other characters who are also affected by violence, corruption, and despair. The novel was adapted into a film in 2007, directed by AndrÃ©s Baiz and starring Marcela Mar, Blas Jaramillo, and DamiÃ¡n AlcÃ¡zar.
 
Another work that reflects Mendoza's interest in the occult and the paranormal is La travesÃ­a del vidente, a novel that tells the story of Heriberto, a young man who has the gift of clairvoyance and can see the future. Heriberto is contacted by a mysterious organization that wants to use his abilities for their own purposes, but he soon realizes that he is in danger and that he must escape from their clutches. Along the way, he meets other people who have similar gifts and who help him to understand his destiny.
 
El libro negro is a collection of short stories that explore different aspects of horror and madness, such as zombies, vampires, ghosts, cannibals, and serial killers. The stories are set in different places and times, from medieval Europe to modern Colombia, and show how fear and evil can manifest in different ways. The book also includes illustrations by the author himself, which add to the macabre and disturbing tone of the stories.
